# dataZine

inexpensive data publishing webapp

## How it works

Using the editor, iterate on a query until you're satisfied with it. Then save
the query and get a url you can hit that will return the query results.

## Why?

Exploring your dataset in a shell is easy, but sharing that data can be a
challenge. Use the web interface to explore your data set, and share ephemeral
queries with your colleages. Or publish multiple zines to create an ad-hoc api,
useful for prototyping.
